## Pizza Cart

I built the Pizza Cart application for Zandile. Since Zandile pizza business is doing good in terms of sales. I decided to create a pizza for her to allow allow customers to add or remove pizza from the pizza cart.

Note:

To navigate into the shopping cart basket : click the shopping cart icon on top of the web page.

You can find the application at: https://tommyshado.github.io/pizza-cart/layouts/index.html

You can also find the unit testing at: https://tommyshado.github.io/pizza-cart/unit-testing/index.test.html
